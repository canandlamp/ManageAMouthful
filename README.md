Software Built For Hardware Yet To Be



Software written for hardware consisting of bit/trit hybrid septets

as homage to the terms "byte," and "nibble," 2 bits and 5 trits constituting the basic unit of polyoption data storage: the "mouthful" . . .

as "e," base of the natural logarithm, has been nailed as most efficient storage unit, 2 bits for every 5 trits averages at this granularity, closest.

memory, registers, and i/o ports, each consisting of arrangements made up from such bit/trit septet mouthfuls
